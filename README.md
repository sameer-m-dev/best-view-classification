# ML - Best View Selection

Build ML model to select the specific view from the given set of different views.

1) Each product has multiple views (front, left, right, back) and only a few views have the information about the product through which you can make the ML model learn its features. Build ML model and explain your approach on how will you select the specific view from the given set of different views.

Example: In the case of footwear, Side view(left/right) has most information regarding the type of heel (high, medium or flat).Similarly, different views have different information for each use case.

2) Identify the closure type of footwear from the data (CSV) provided which has imbalanced data distribution across 6 classes. You can collect more data using web scraping or different sources. Build ML model which effectively identifies the closure type of the footwear.
